## Short Form

That's what Twitter is for right? You can find my very limited tweeting at [@sroberts](https://www.twitter.com/sroberts).

## Long Form

I have blogged, somewhat inconsistently, going back to 2014. That writing is all on this [site](/blog).

## Books

### Intelligence Driven Incident Response

I was honored to write the book [Intelligence Driven Incident Response](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920043614.do) with [Rebekah Brown](https://twitter.com/PDXbek) for O'Reilly.

### [Huntpedia](https://www.threathunting.net/files/huntpedia.pdf)

The folks at sqrrl (now Amazon) created what they called "..an aggregation of wisdom from some seasoned threat hunters" and asked to include my post on [Waiting vs. Passivity in DFIR](/blog/2016-12-19-waiting-vs-passivity-in-dfir/).
