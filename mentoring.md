> “A mentor is not someone who walks ahead of us and tells us how they did it.
A mentor is someone who walks alongside us to guide us on what we can do.”

― Simon Sinek

I've been lucky enough to have some incredible mentors. I feel it's my duty to attempt to do the same. If you think I can help you that way please try to request some time to chat via [SavvyCal](https://savvycal.com/sroberts/chat). I'll be happy to help you out if possible.
