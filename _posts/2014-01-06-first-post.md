title: My First New Post

So after a lot of harassment by the likes of [Ben Balter](http://ben.balter.com) and some other GitHubber's I've decided it's a good time to learn [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) and start a blog. I've largely been terrible about blogging, but frankly I think I've never had quite such a good handle on what interests me and how to talk about it, so here's hoping this one goes better.

I'm hoping to share:

* Some developing ideas
* Projects I've been working on
* Improve my writing
* Things I've been learning/trying to learn
* And responding in longer form to a few other folks on the Internet

So hit me up on Twitter ([@sroberts](https://twitter.com/sroberts)) and let me know what you think.
