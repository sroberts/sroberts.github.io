title: Home Office Setup
---

One of the best things about my current job (though it's becoming less unique) is the chance to work remotely. This is beneficial in differnt ways, not the least of which is the flexibility to work from home. This gave me the opportunity to customize my work environment in a way I never could in a traditional office.

## Workspace Equipment

- [Standing Desk: NextDesk Terra](http://www.nextdesks.com/terra)
- [Standing Desk Pad: CumulusPRO Commercial Grade Anti-Fatigue Comfort Mat ](http://www.amazon.com/CumulusPRO-Commercial-Anti-Fatigue-Comfort-24-inch/dp/B005UA2WO2/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1423326241&sr=8-3&keywords=standing+desk+pad)
- Chair: Meh...
    - I got some cheap chair years ago at Office(Depot\|Max) and have been using that far too long. It's the kind of chair that encourages bad posture and generally unhealthy sitting.

## Computer Equipment

- [Laptop: Apple 15" Macbook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/)
- [Display: Apple 27" Thuderbolt Cinema Display](http://www.apple.com/displays/)
- [Second Screen: Apple iPad Mini 2](http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini)
- Secondary Laptop
    - I took an old personal laptop created a personal security server. Right now I'm running [@technoskald's Maltrieve](https://github.com/technoskald/maltrieve), feeding into @botherder's [Viper](https://github.com/botherder/viper) & [Cuckoo Sandbox](https://github.com/cuckoobox/cuckoo). I'm also running [Netflix Scumblr](https://github.com/netflix/scumblr) for social network monitoring.
- [Headphones: Audio-Technica ATH-M50 Monitor Headphones](http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50-Professional-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B000ULAP4U)
- [Microphone: Logitech USB Desktop Microphone](http://support.logitech.com/product/usb-desktop-microphone)
  - Necessary given the number of video chats I'm on and this one is worth every penny.

_So yeah... I basically have an Apple Store at home. You can question my choices, but it's the equipment that works for me._

## Environment

This is the toughest one by far. There are a couple points that I think make a difference:

- The ability to close a door is key. I don't understand people who work in their living rooms, not due to the hustle and bustle (I actually like that) but more from the constant "seeing home things I could be working on". When you're in the zone the last thing you need is a distraction, and when you aren't the last thing you need is an excuse.
- I find I need people time, so my mornings are often spent in a local coffee shop.

## Coworkers

![Mira](/public/mira-coworker.jpg)

I have one primary coworker, our boxer/puggle (we think) mix named Mira. She isn't good at DIFR work, but I think a  dog is actually a great thing to have for working from home. It's nice to have another living thing in the house, as a whole day at home can get lonesome. A dog also forces you to get up and go for a walk once or twice a day, which is great for any number of reasons. While she can be a bit distracting from time to time I highly recommend a canine coworker.

## Conclusion

Is this setup ideal? I'm sure I could improve it but for now it's pretty good and I do feel like it does a lot to make me productive. Working from home is nothing short of game changing for some so called knowledge workers, but learning to do it well makes a big difference.
