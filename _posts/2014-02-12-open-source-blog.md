title: Open Source Blog
---

So it's been more days than I'd like since my last blog, sadly since I've been dealing with some discomfort in my arms along the lines of an RSI, something I plan on discussing more. That said I'm on the mend, and wanted at least a small post so I don't feel like such a slacker.

Since I setup my blog a number of folks have asked me what I'm using, how it's set up, etc. To make that easier to understand I decided to open source my blog so a similar setup is just a fork away. I'm also excited since this will allow me to publish content without actually pushing it to my blog, giving me a chance to solicit feedback without having to email markdown files.

## The Repository:

[sroberts.github.io](https://github.com/sroberts/sroberts.github.io) - There it is. The whole thing

## Quick Rundown
Here's whats behind my blog:

### Blog Package: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
The amazing open source blogging platform works as well for me as anyone else. I write Markdown all day, so it's an easy to way to write blog content as well.

### Blog Theme: [Hyde](http://andhyde.com)
Gotta love a literary turn of phrase, Hyde gave me a great look without forcing me into lengthy HTML/CSS customization. I trust the professionals.

### Hosting: [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com)
Create pull request, commit post, merge pull request, have blog. Easy.

### Text Editor: [Vim](http://www.vim.org)
I've been trying to force myself to use Vim for most things, this is no exception. Square's Maximum Awesome package makes it usable.

### Spell Checking: [Aspell](http://aspell.net)
I've already mentioned how great Aspell is, but it's really a life saver for words I put in front of real people.

### Image Editor: [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com)
On the rare cases I post images and need them edited Pixelmator is the best combo of features & ease of use. 

### Bonus: [hub](http://hub.github.com)
It's great being able to do things like open a pull request without leaving the command line. I also use ``hub browse`` to jump to the right place on the web more than I care to admit.

### Bonus: [GitHub Pages Gem](https://github.com/github/pages-gem)
This gem keeps everything inline, making sure you always stay up to date on Jekyll version, Pages compatibility, etc.

That's the technology behind it. I also use the repository Issues to keep track of posts I'd like to write, notes, etc. 

## Going Forward
I welcome feedback and suggestions via the open [issues](https://github.com/sroberts/sroberts.github.io/issues/). While I want to avoid discussions of content in there please feel free to comment on what I'm planning to write and changes I plan to make. Feel free to rip off content, just give credit where credit is due. And thanks to all those who built the tools, I couldn't do it without you.
