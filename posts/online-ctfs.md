I’ve been lucky enough to play in a number of computer attack & defend (sometimes only one or the other) [Capture The Flags](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security). They’ve been some of the best learning experiences I’ve ever had and a ton of fun. It really compresses all of cyber security, minus that boring policy stuff, into a smaller time frame.

Even with all the benefits there is one tough part: you can’t always spend a weekend in a friends basement with a pallet of Redbull or on the floor at DefCon CTF. Until CTF season rolls around this spring there are two new all online CTFs from big name companies:

- Square/Matasano: [MicroCorruption](https://microcorruption.com/)
- Stripe: Stripe-CTF (Link appears to be down at this point.)

I took a quick look at MicroCorruption over lunch and it’s unique take focused on embedded software security is fascinating. They’ve put together a great interface, putting hardware debugging & exploitation in a web browser. I’m really excited to get into Stripe-CTF, which seems a little more language/programmatic centric rather than exploitation driven. I think I’ll be starting on MicroCorruption this weekend, but either way they are two different topics to learn, both a great way to do it.
