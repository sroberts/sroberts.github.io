Iâ€™ve been lucky and had a really wide variety of experiences in information security throughout my career. Government & non-government. Vendor & practitioner. Finance & dotcom. Iâ€™ve seen a lot of stuff. Itâ€™s to the point that I get even more excited about the stuff Iâ€™ve never done. One of those moments happened a few weeks ago when the [Dragos](https://dragos.com) team released their [Crash Override](https://dragos.com/blog/crashoverride/CrashOverride-01.pdf) report.

> **Full Disclosure:** I know a few of the folks over at Dragos and consider them friends but friends that value good, even critical, analysis.

The Crash Override report is an investigation into a campaign against an electric utility infrastructure in Ukraine. Now I donâ€™t know a lot about Industrial Control System (ICS) security, so a report like this is fascinating to me. Itâ€™s a view into a whole different world, a different type of network & system infrastructure, a different set of response actions, new stakeholder needs, and an adversary with TTPs I donâ€™t even know. While moving from finance network defense to dotcom network defense had a lot of overlap (both largely privacy focus) ICS networks are totally different (such as a bigger focus on availability).

Between self driving cars, the connected grid, IOT, robotics, etc I think industrial networks and attacks are a growing area of risk and Iâ€™m not alone ([Kaspersky](https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/reports/2017/03/28/threat-landscape-for-industrial-automation-systems-in-the-second-half-of-2016/) & [HuffPo](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-wagner/the-growing-threat-of-cyb_b_10114374.html) to start). Enough so that I feel like I need to know more. Thus the Crash Override Chronicles, my series digging into this report and likely a lot of secondary things that come out of it. Iâ€™m planning a structured approach digging into a few different aspects of Crash Override.

### The Plan

Iâ€™m planning to break down my understanding based on the following five posts which Iâ€™m calling the Crash Override Chronicles:

- **[Overall Report:](https://medium.com/@sroberts/the-crash-override-chronicles-overall-8389ef178fdf)** A run through of the whole report calling out areas I need to focus on learning or investigating.
- **Victimâ€Šâ€”â€ŠDomain Understanding:** I know I donâ€™t know much about the ICS domain and the power generation/transport world. Iâ€™m going to focus on gaining context.
- **Capabilityâ€Šâ€”â€ŠCrash Override Malware:** The report focused on the specific piece of malware the adversary used called Crash Override. Time for some malware analysis.
- **Infrastructureâ€Šâ€”â€ŠCrash Override Infrastructure:** Malware does not operate alone, even in the ICS world ([nope, even the one you think worked by itself](https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf)). Thereâ€™s always infrastructure for delivery, command & control, and often actions over target.
- **Adversaryâ€Šâ€”â€ŠElectrum:** Lastly Iâ€™d like to take all this and dig into the adversary behind the Crash Override campaign. Thereâ€™s been a lot of speculation, and I donâ€™t make any promises, but it makes a good conclusion.

For those of you playing at home youâ€™ll notice that these four characteristics (Victim, Capability, Infrastructure, and Adversary) make up the 4 points of the [Diamond Model](http://www.activeresponse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/diamond.pdf). This was totally accidental as I laid this project out, but the model emerged, and so Iâ€™m making that a part of the plan.
