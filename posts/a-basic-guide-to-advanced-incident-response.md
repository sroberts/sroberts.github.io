On 5/5 was lucky enough to be invited to speak at an education technical conference [Tech Talk Live](http://www.techtalklive.org/) Cyber Security Symposium. I wanted to do something new, something different. I’ve long been an advocate of intelligence driven incident response, but had never seen a sufficiently useful presentation to introduce this complex but powerful work flow to others. So I tried to make one.

### Presentation

Overall I was pleased with how the talk was received. Schools face a myriad of cyber threats from the mundane to the sophisticated, but lack resources in terms of money, people, and time. I don’t know if central PA schools are going to see booming intel driven IR programs, but I hope there were some interesting ideas for them that may be useful.

I also learned a lot, as I always do, giving the talk live for the first time. I plan on revising it, and hopefully giving an improved version.

### Presentation Design

If you made it this far I also wanted to call attention that this was the first presentation I’ve fully built and gave using [Zach Holaman](http://zachholman.com/)’s [Speaking.io](http://speaking.io/) guide. Working at GitHub with so many amazing designers I’ve become conscious of both the importance of design in presentation and the benefit of better preparation. I recommend it highly for new speakers to learn and seasoned speakers to level up.
