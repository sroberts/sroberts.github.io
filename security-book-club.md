One of my [goals](http://sroberts.github.io/2015/01/06/2015-professional-goals/) this year is to read at least one technical book a month. Multiple people have expressed interest in being a part of this "book club". Here's the current schedule.

## 2014 Schedule

| Month | Book |
| ----- | ---- |
| January | Digital Forensics & Incident Response |
| February | The Art of Intelligence |
| March | Practical Malware Analysis |
| April | Understanding Computation: From Simple Machines to Impossible Programs |
| May | TBD |
| June | TBD |
| July | TBD |
| August | TBD |
| September | TBD |
| October | TBD |
| November | TBD |
| December | TBD |

_We'll be discussing the books on Friday afternoons via Google Hangout._
