title: Old School CTI

Technology as a whole is all about trends, what's cool, what's last year, etc. This is great given it drives innovation, but leads to a false belief that everything really is new, everything really was just created. Yet at the risk of getting biblical "Nothing under the sun is truly new.". This applies to technology as a whole, security specifically, and certainly my favorite topics CTI &amp; DFIR. So many of the things we treat as brand new ideas or innovations aren't new. They're things that have existed for dozens if not hundreds of years.
