![Hey its books!](http://www.gradesaver.com/assets/footer/books-c7dac18934e0bad9c1787ba8a7686bc7e6371dcc4443be965459fc78b6c86954.jpg)

A few weeks ago while teaching [SANS FOR578](https://www.sans.org/course/cyber-threat-intelligence) I got a great question from a student: What is a good cyber threat intelligence reading list? It's a question I'd meant to answer before, have a list prepared, and is of interest to a lot of folks. So instead of sending back an email (I mean, I emailed back, HI MATT, but along with that) I figured I'd share with the world (and have something to reference. So here's my list of things you should read when getting started in cyber threat intelligence:

## <i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"></i> Books

Get that library card or Amazon account ready, here are my favorite books on CTI.

*   [The Cuckoo’s Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage by Clifford Stoll](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18154.The_Cuckoo_s_Egg?from_search=true) - The best narrative version of the DFIR & CTI world I can imagine it reads better than Tom Clancy and tells a real story of hunting espionage. A must read (and great for non-technical folks as well). Also a great gauge of interest.
*   [Secrets and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World by Bruce Schneier](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/304482.Secrets_and_Lies) - Written in 2000 it was my introduction to the technical problems in security and has been my go to “First Technical Security Book” choice. I’m reevaluating it now (against  the [Defensive Security Handbook: Best Practices for Securing Infrastructure by Lee Brotherston](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31805609-defensive-security-handbook?from_search=true)).
*   [Incident Response & Computer Forensics, Third Edition by Kevin Mandia](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16691213-incident-response-computer-forensics-third-edition?from_search=true) - Ultimately CTI collection is the output of incident response.  Doing CTI well requires a deep understanding of all of Incident Response and this book is still the best book to learn it from.
*   [Practical Malware Analysis: The Hands-On Guide to Dissecting Malicious Software by Michael Sikorski](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10677461-practical-malware-analysis) - A huge amount of CTI comes down to malware analysis. Malware RE is a big part of understanding the capabilities of an adversary. This is the best introduction I know.
*   [Thwarting Enemies at Home and Abroad: How to Be a Counterintelligence Officer by William R. Johnson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5979810-thwarting-enemies-at-home-and-abroad) - **SHOCKER:** You’re not an intelligence analyst if you’re doing CTI. You’re a counter intelligence analyst. Many of the same techniques, but a totally different application. Understanding traditional counterintelligence tradecraft is essential and this is my favorite book to learn it.
*   [The Psychology of Intelligence Analysis](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/PsychofIntelNew.pdf) & [Structured Analytic Techniques For Intelligence Analysis by Richards J. Heuer Jr.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7818985-structured-analytic-techniques-for-intelligence-analysis) - Analysis is often the least understood (and honestly least undertaken) piece of CTI. We need to get better at it. Richards Heuer literally wrote the book(s) on this.
*   [Dark Territory: The Secret History of Cyber War by Fred Kaplan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25814289-dark-territory) - Another more story centric book Dark Territory is a history of the development of America’s cyber warfare capability.

## <i class="fa fa-file-text" aria-hidden="true"></i> Papers

Plenty of key concepts don't merit a full book but are more in the 10-30 page range which are perfect for academic style papers. These are good ones to start with:

*   [Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains by Hutchins, Cloppert & Amin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf) - The infamous kill chain paper. Love it or hate it this is a seminal work defining a model that every CTI analyst needs to understand even if they don’t use it directly.
*   [The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis by Caltagirone, Pendergast, & Betz](http://www.activeresponse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/diamond.pdf) - Another key model I admit I dismissed the Diamond model at first. Four simple buckets, how big a deal is that? Turns out it's a huge one after I got past the TLDR. Not simple actually, but elegant.
*   **Adversaries** - Most CTI programs are focused on four major sets of adversaries: China, Russia, the United States, & everyone else.  Who’s important will depend on your threat model, but passing familiarity with everyone is important. Here’s are my favorites:
    *   **China:** [APT1 Report](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf) & [Op SMN/Axiom Report](http://www.novetta.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Executive_Summary-Final_1.pdf) - One sorta basic, one more advanced. A good cross section.
	*   **Russia:** [Peering Into the Aquarium](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3461560-Google-Aquarium-Clean.html)  - A leaked Google report (everyone has leaks) but the best survey of Russian threat actors I know of.
	*   **United States:** [Equation Group](https://securelist.com/files/2015/02/Equation_group_questions_and_answers.pdf) - No one says US but its very clear. A great idea of what everyone wants to have.
	*   **Everyone Else:** [Careto](https://kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/vlpdfs/unveilingthemask_v1.0.pdf), [Ocean Lotus](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/cyber-espionage-apt32.html), & [Dark Seoul](https://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/white-papers/wp-dissecting-operation-troy.pdf) - A wide variety in three groups. Varied tactics & goals.

## <i class="fa fa-sticky-note" aria-hidden="true"></i> Non-Computer Network Defense Specific Reading

While the books above are very technically focused on computer network defense (CND)  but there are a wide variety of subjects useful to a CTI analyst that go beyond CND & intelligence. Here's my starting list:

*   [Near and Distant Neighbors: A New History of Soviet Intelligence by Jonathan Haslam](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22929502-near-and-distant-neighbors) - An exploration of the formation of the modern Russian intelligence apparatus. Studying those evolutions is interesting.
*   [The Art of War by Sun Tzu](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10534.The_Art_of_War) - Judge if you want, it’s a solid read detailing the meta nature of conflict and espionage. Yes it’s overdone, yes it was over quoted, but it’s still valuable. Ignore it at your own peril.
*   [Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow) - So I haven’t read this one… but I’ve been meaning too. From podcasts and discussions with friends it's a perfect for this list so I’ll add it, even if it is inspirational. Very metacognitive.

## <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> One Last Reading Idea

[Rebekah Brown](https://www.twitter.com/pdxbeks) and I have been working very hard and are excited to share our own addition to this list:

[![Intelligence Driven Incident Response Cover](https://covers.oreillystatic.com/images/0636920043614/rc_lrg.jpg)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920043614.do)

Our book is meant to cover both the network defense process and the intelligence process but more importantly how they can be integrated. Ultimately computer networks defense takes intrusion detection, incident response, & intelligence.

## <i class="fa fa-film" aria-hidden="true"></i> Bonus! [Jiro Dreams of Sushi](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772925/) & [Sour Grapes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5728684/)

As I was originally thinking about this post I thought it would be nothing but Intelligence & Incident Response books, but as I kept considering the topic it kept expanding and I wanted to be encompassing.

Jiro Dreams of Sushi is a beautiful documentary about food, but more than that about the depth of effort and dedication it takes to really be the best at a craft. This is all the more important in an adversarial vocation like CTI, where in many cases it matters who's better, you or the adversary. For me I would like to be known as having the kind of tenacity as Jiro and those who work with him.

Sour Grapes touches on a different but no less important, borderline unteachable, aspect of CTI/IR. I won't spoil the surprise, but Sour Grapes is a wonderful lesson in the investigative desire, that need to track down the adversary and figure out their techniques and goals.

I recommend both highly and they're both excellent to watch even with non-CND people. They also pair with tuna nigiri and an off-dry Riesling.
